# Latest Update
(2025-12-13) This season the bot now makes a dedicated channel for all games (#game-day-watch). The option to have it create a individual channel per game is currently unavailable. In the future, you will be able to configure the bot for either modes.

### Permissions for NHLBot
 
The bot requirs the following permissions: "Manage Channels", "Read Messages", "Send Messages", "Manage Messages", "Embed Links", "Read Message History"
